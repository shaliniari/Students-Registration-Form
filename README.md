A standard style for README files

Your README file is normally the first entry point to your code. It should tell people why they should use your module, how they can install it, and how they can use it. Standardizing how you write your README makes creating and maintaining your READMEs easier. Great documentation takes work!

This repository contains:

The specification for how a standard README should look.
A link to a linter you can use to keep your README maintained (work in progress).
A link to a generator you can use to create standard READMEs.
A badge to point to this spec.
Examples of standard READMEs - such as this file you are reading.
Standard Readme is designed for open source libraries. Although itâ€™s historically made for Node and npm projects, it also applies to libraries in other languages and package managers.
